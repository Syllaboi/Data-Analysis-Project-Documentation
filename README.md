 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/d2jhX3dzgYk)


<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<b>I developed a smart Airtable-based content calendar for a small digital marketing team to streamline content management across Twitter, Instagram, blog, and email campaigns. The system centralized planning, task assignment, and publishing workflows, reducing content creation time by 60% and increasing on-time publishing by 85%. The project enhanced team collaboration and provided clear visibility into content pipelines.
</b>

<h2>Key Metrics</h2>

<b>Time Savings: Reduced content creation and scheduling time by 60% through automated workflows.



On-Time Publishing: Improved on-time content delivery from 50% to 85%.



Content Output: Managed 120+ monthly posts across platforms (30 Twitter, 20 Instagram, 10 blog, 60 email).



Team Efficiency: Decreased manual coordination by 70% with centralized task tracking.



Error Reduction: Cut content approval errors (e.g., typos, off-brand visuals) by 40% via structured workflows.



Engagement Impact: Post-launch, social media engagement increased by 25% due to consistent scheduling.

<h2>My Contributions</h2>


I led the design and implementation of the content creation workflow, from requirement gathering to deployment and troubleshooting. My specific contributions included:





- <b>Workflow Design</b>: Created a tailored Airtable content calendar with tables for Content Ideas, Drafts, Assigned Tasks, and Publish Status.



- **Database Configuration**: Set up linked tables and fields (e.g., "Linked Draft" to connect Content Ideas to Drafts) for seamless data flow.



- **Automation Setup**: Configured automations for task reminders, approval notifications, and publishing alerts via email and Slack.



- Tagging System: Implemented a tagging system for platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Blog, Email) and content types (Promotional, Educational, Engagement).



- **Custom Views**: Built role-specific views (e.g., Writer’s Drafts, Editor’s Approvals, Scheduler’s Calendar) to enhance usability.



- **Troubleshooting**: Resolved linking issues between Content Ideas and Drafts tables by adjusting field types and relationships.



- **Documentation**: Provided a user guide for the team, detailing how to input ideas, track drafts, and monitor publishing schedules.



- **Portfolio Enhancement**: Crafted a compelling Upwork portfolio entry highlighting the project’s impact and my technical expertise.


<h2>Steps and Process</h2>

1.  <h3>Requirement Gathering:</h3>





- Collaborated with the digital marketing team to identify pain points: scattered workflows, missed deadlines, and lack of visibility.



- Defined goals: centralize content planning, automate reminders, and improve publishing consistency across Twitter, Instagram, blog, and email.



2. <h3>System Design:</h3>





- Selected Airtable for its flexibility and automation capabilities.



- Designed four core tables:





   <b>Content Ideas</b>: Fields for Idea Title, Platform, Content Type, Proposed Date, Submitter.



   <b>Drafts</b>: Fields for Draft Title, Linked Idea, Writer, Status (In Progress, Ready for Review), Due Date.



   <b>Assigned Tasks</b>: Fields for Task Name, Assignee, Due Date, Status (To Do, In Progress, Done).



   <b>Publish Status</b>: Fields for Post Title, Platform, Scheduled Date, Status (Scheduled, Published, Archived).



- Established relationships, e.g., linking Content Ideas to Drafts via a "Linked Draft" field.



3. <h3>Database Setup:</h3>





- Configured Airtable tables with appropriate field types (e.g., single-select for Platform, date for Due Date).



- Added a tagging system to filter content by platform and type for easy sorting.



- Tested table relationships to ensure data integrity (e.g., Drafts correctly linked to Content Ideas).



4. <h3>Automation Configuration:</h3>





- Set up automations in Airtable:





     Email reminders to writers when drafts were due in 48 hours.



     Slack notifications to editors for drafts ready for review.



     Alerts to schedulers when content was approved for publishing.



- Integrated Zapier to connect Airtable with team Slack channels for real-time updates.



- Automated status updates (e.g., Drafts marked "Ready for Review" triggered task creation in Assigned Tasks).



5. <h3>Custom Views:</h3>





- Created role-specific views to streamline workflows:





     Writers: Grid view of assigned drafts with due dates.



     Editors: Kanban view of drafts pending review.



     Schedulers: Calendar view of scheduled posts.



- Shared views with the team to ensure accessibility and clarity.



6. <h3>Testing and Troubleshooting:</h3>





- Identified an issue where the "Linked Draft" field failed to connect Content Ideas to Drafts due to mismatched field types.



- Resolved by converting the field to a linked record type and re-importing data.



- Conducted user testing with the team to validate workflows and gather feedback.



7. <h3>Deployment and Training:</h3>





- Rolled out the Airtable system to the team, providing a 5-page user guide with step-by-step instructions.



- Conducted a 1-hour training session via Zoom to demonstrate table usage, automation triggers, and view navigation.



- Set up a feedback channel in Slack for ongoing support.



8. <h3>Reporting and Portfolio:</h3>





- Generated a project report for the client, detailing time savings (60%), on-time publishing (85%), and engagement growth (25%).



- Created a social media post: "Streamlined content workflows for a digital team, cutting planning time by 60% and boosting on-time posts to 85%! #ContentMarketing #Automation".



- Developed a portfolio entry titled "Content Creation Workflow Automation", emphasizing my role, results, and tools used.
