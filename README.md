<h1>From n8n Struggles to Google Apps Script Success: Building a Remote Job Alert System</h1>

*Published: June 21, 2025 | Author: Oluwasegun Salako*

This project chronicles my journey to create an automated remote job alert system. What started as a simple idea turned into a rewarding challenge, teaching me resilience, scripting skills, and the power of tailored solutions.

## The Initial Plan: n8n and a Simple Workflow

I aimed to fetch remote job postings hourly from the Remotive API, filter them by keywords like "automation" and "n8n," and send alerts to Telegram while logging details in a Google Sheet. I began with n8n, setting up an HTTP Request node, a Code node for filtering, and output nodes. However, issues arose: only one of 1,573 jobs processed, despite tweaking filters and connections. Hours of retries revealed n8n's complexity for this task.

## Pivoting to Google Apps Script: A Fresh Start

Frustrated, I turned to Google Apps Script, creating a "Job Alerts" Google Sheet and writing a custom script. Early hurdles included URL length errors and HTML tags in descriptions, but I learned to limit message lengths, strip tags, and handle authorizations. This shift gave me control and introduced me to JavaScript.

## Building the Solution

The final script fetches Remotive jobs, filters by keywords, sends Telegram alerts, and updates the Sheet with new postings. It runs hourly via a trigger. Here's the working code:

```javascript
function removeHtmlTags(text) {
  return text ? text.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '').trim() : "";
}

function checkJobs() {
  var remotiveUrl = "https://remotive.com/api/remote-jobs";
  
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(remotiveUrl);
  var remotiveData = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
  var remotiveJobs = remotiveData.jobs;

  var keywords = ["automation", "data entry", "zapier", "workflow", "airtable", "notion", "n8n", "workflow automation"];
  var botToken = "8******vMSiHAx*****"; // Replace with your Telegram bot token
  var chatId = "644471057"; // Replace with your Telegram chat ID

  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var lastRow = sheet.getLastRow();
  var existingLinks = sheet.getRange("C2:C" + lastRow).getValues().flat();

  remotiveJobs.forEach(function(job) {
    var title = job.title ? job.title.toLowerCase() : "";
    var matches = keywords.some(keyword => title.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()));
    var link = job.url;

    if (matches && !existingLinks.includes(link)) {
      var maxLength = 1000;
      var description = job.description ? removeHtmlTags(job.description).substring(0, maxLength) : "No description";
      var message = `ðŸŽ‰ New Job Alert!\n` +
                    `Title: ${job.title}\n` +
                    `Company: ${job.company_name || "N/A"}\n` +
                    `Link: ${link}\n` +
                    `Description: ${description}\n` +
                    `Date: ${job.publication_date || "N/A"}\n` +
                    `Location: ${job.candidate_required_location || "Remote"}\n`;

      var telegramUrl = `https://api.telegram.org/bot${botToken}/sendMessage?chat_id=${chatId}&text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
      UrlFetchApp.fetch(telegramUrl);

      sheet.appendRow([
        job.title,
        job.company_name || "N/A",
        link,
        removeHtmlTags(job.description),
        job.publication_date || "N/A",
        job.candidate_required_location || "Remote"
      ]);
    }
  });
}
```

- **Setup**: Create a Google Sheet named "Job Alerts" with headers: Job Title, Company, Link, Description, Publication Date, Preferred Location. Add the script via Extensions > Apps Script, save, and set an hourly trigger.
- **Credentials**: Replace `botToken` and `chatId` with your Telegram bot token (from BotFather) and chat ID.

## Lessons Learned

- **Resilience**: Persistent debugging in n8n taught me when to pivot.
- **Scripting Skills**: JavaScript basics (loops, APIs) became accessible through Apps Script.
- **Simplicity**: A custom script outperformed n8n for my needs.
- **Potential Unlocked**: This project sparked interest in further coding exploration.

## Looking Ahead

Iâ€™m sticking with Remotive for now, but the scriptâ€™s flexibility allows future additions like Remote OKâ€™s API or broader keywords. Next steps might include email notifications or daily summaries. This journey has not only met my job search needs but also ignited a passion for automation.
